# Welcome
This is a simple FAQ plugin to be used within WordPress. It allows for you to easily add a FAQ section to any page through the use of a shortcode and a custom post type.

# Installation and Use
In order to use the plugin simply download or take a clone of the repository and add the folders to your websites plugins folder.

Once done you will be able to see the plugin as an option to activate within the backend of your WordPress website.

From there you will now have a custom post type FAQs available to use.

To start displaying your FAQ sections you will need to create them in the FAQ custom post type. Simply fill in the title and content for however many sections you would like.

* Allow users to select theme colours for the Accordian via options page.
* Allow users to change Query results (Amount of posts / Only recent FAQs etc) via shortcode.
* Feedback system (Per question? Per FAQ page?)
* "Ask a new question" - Process, allowing visitors to ask a question and the site owner to respond.

# Notes
This is a small personal project that I hope others find useful. It's aim was to teach a co-worker git and myself Wordpress plugin development. This plugin uses [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) - If you don't have it, you simply won't get icons.

Any bugs or features you would like to see? We'd love to hear from you.
