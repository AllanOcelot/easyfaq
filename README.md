# Welcome
This is a simple FAQ plugin to be used within WordPress. It allows for you to easily add multiple accordion style FAQ's across your Wordpress website.

# Installation and Use
In order to use the plugin simply download to your plugins folder and active in the backend of Wordpress. That's it!.

To add an FAQ - add a new post to the 'FAQS' post type on the left sidebar.
You can pop anything you'd like into the content -  images, video, heck even memes if you'd like.

To add an FAQ display to an existing page, simply edit the page and add the below short code.
This will add a functioning FAQ section, there are some options below.

```
[easyFAQ]
```

# ShortCode Options
EasyFAQ is a very simple plugin, but I've tried to give you some basic options to make it robust.

* To set a custom colour for easyFAQ simply add the colour attribute and supply a colour code
```
[easyFAQ colour="#000000"]
```
* To search only FAQ's by a specific category, provide the category name (This is super useful if you want more than one FAQ across your website!)
```
[easyFAQ category="example category"]
```

This plugin was created by me, Allan - find me at [A Work Of Code](http://www.aworkofcode.com).

# Notes
This plugin uses [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) - If your website does not have it installed, you won't see the open/close icons.
